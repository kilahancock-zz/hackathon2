Under their umbrella there are 201 food banks around the US that make up a sophisticated distribution network that captures donations & surplus food in order to redeliver to local agencies like food shelves, soup kitchens, homeless shelters including those that serve children and seniors. These agencies rely on food banks to capture food opportunities that are too large for them to handle. <br>Our non-profit food bank distributed over 7.4 million pounds of food last year to over 230 hunger relief agencies and programs within our 21 county service area in northwest, west central Minnesota and part of Grand Forks, North Dakota. <br>North Country Food Bank has been serving this area since 1983. We are working hard to evolve in a sustainable manner, developing innovative programs to assist our manufacturing & agriculture partners while improving the lives of those in need.","websiteURL":"http://northcountryfoodbank.org/","tagLine":"Ending Hunger","charityName":"North Country Food Bank, Inc.","ein":"411459758","currentRating":{"ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/4stars.png"},"rating":4},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":18,"causeName":"Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=18&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/food_banks.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":3550656,"nteeType":null,"incomeAmount":11399771,"nteeSuffix":null,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"September, 2019","rulingDate":"May, 1984","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","deductibilityCode":"1","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"September","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","deductibilityDetail":null,"nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"MN","city":"East Grand Forks","postalCode":"56721","streetAddress1":"1011 11th Ave. NE","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/411459758/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"North Country Food Bank, Inc.","ein":"411459758","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14846&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/411459758"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=13683&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Since 1973, Volunteers Enlisted to Assist People (VEAP) has provided services to help low-income individuals and families meet their immediate needs and attain stability.

The Ballard Food Bank currently serves over 1,200 individuals a week living in Ballard, Magnolia and Queen Anne through our grocery-style food bank alone. We reach home-bound individuals through our Home Delivery Program and provide meals for students on the weekend through our Weekend Food For Kids Program. And food is just the first step - we also offer services such as a personal hygiene bar, mail services to clients (an essential detail when looking for employment or housing), and a Community Resource Hub where clients can get emergency financial assistance and referrals to on-site partner agencies so they can get help with their basic needs in one place.","websiteURL":"http://www.ballardfoodbank.org/","tagLine":"Neighbors helping neighbors","charityName":"Ballard Food Bank","ein":"911428805","currentRating":{"ratingImage":{"small":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3starsb.png","large":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/stars/3stars.png"},"rating":3},"category":{"categoryName":"Human Services","categoryID":6,"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.categories&categoryid=6&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/icons/categories/health.png?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"cause":{"causeID":18,"causeName":"Food Banks, Food Pantries, and Food Distribution","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&cgid=6&cuid=18&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","image":"https://d20umu42aunjpx.cloudfront.net/_gfx_/causes/small/food_banks.gif?utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8"},"irsClassification":{"deductibility":"Contributions are deductible","subsection":"501(c)(3)","assetAmount":5011515,"nteeType":null,"incomeAmount":4379225,"nteeSuffix":null,"filingRequirement":"990 (all other) or 990EZ return","classification":"Charitable Organization","latest990":"September, 2018","rulingDate":"March, 1989","nteeCode":null,"groupName":null,"affiliation":"Independent - the organization is an independent organization or an independent auxiliary (i.e., not affiliated with a National, Regional, or Geographic grouping of organizations).","deductibilityCode":"1","foundationStatus":"Organization which receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or the general public   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)","nteeClassification":null,"accountingPeriod":"September","exemptOrgStatusCode":"01","exemptOrgStatus":"Unconditional Exemption","deductibilityDetail":null,"nteeLetter":null},"mailingAddress":{"country":null,"stateOrProvince":"WA","city":"Seattle","postalCode":"98107","streetAddress1":"5130 Leary Avenue, NW","streetAddress2":null},"advisories":{"severity":null,"active":{"_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/911428805/Advisories?status=ACTIVE"}}}},"organization":{"charityName":"Ballard Food Bank","ein":"911428805","charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14833&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","_rapid_links":{"related":{"href":"https://api.data.charitynavigator.org/v2/Organizations/911428805"}}}},{"charityNavigatorURL":"https://www.charitynavigator.org/?bay=search.summary&orgid=14859&utm_source=DataAPI&utm_content=6bc9f3c8","mission":"Founded in 1988, West Seattle Food Bank's (WSFB) mission is to provide food security and community connections to our neighbors in need.
